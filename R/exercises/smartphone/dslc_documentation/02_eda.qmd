We examined and cleaned the smartphone activity data in the file `01_cleaning.qmd`. In this document, you will conduct your own an EDA of the smartphone activity data. 

You'll want to start by loading some libraries, loading the data and cleaning and pre-processing it using the relevant functions.



## High-level summary of the data

Conduct a high-level summary of the data. For example, you may want to look at some histograms and scatterplots. 

## Other explorations

Create some sections that involve a question-answer exploration, keeping the overall project in mind as you go.

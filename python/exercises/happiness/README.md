# World Happiness prediction poject

For this project, your task is to predict a country's happiness score. The data we will use was initially downloaded from the world happiness report website (https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/#appendices-and-data) where more information can be found. 

In this folder, you will find several files. 

- The raw data file (`data/WHR2018Chapter2OnlineData.xls`)

- The code for producing a simplified version of the raw data file (`vds_code/R/cleanHappiness.R`)
